# What is a Hack?

A "hack" in a codebase doesn't have any relation with actual "hacking" it is an often improvised solution that solves a problem but isn't a proper solution.
It's a kind of shortcut or a makeshift fix intended to make something work temporarily or to get around a particular issue.

In essence, it's like using duct tape for a DIY project: it can hold things together, but it might not be the most reliable or stable solution.

## Why is it in the documentation?

Hacks by their nature are often hard to understand if you don't already know what they are.
And sometime understanding why a hack has been made instead of a proper solution is necessary to make that proper solution.
This is the reason documenting the why, how and when of hacks is crucial.

## But if it works, it works, right?

Yes, if it works, it works... except when it doesn't.

Hacks are a form of [technical debt] and like any kind of [technical debt] they should be avoided when possible and reduced over time.
