# Debugging

Whether you're a player troubleshooting an issue, or a developer ironing out a kink in the code, debugging is crucial. Modern Warfare Cubed comes with various debugging tools to assist you.

## Getting Started with Debugging

Here, we provide essential debugging information that should be included in every bug report you submit.

### Debug Logs

Modern Warfare Cubed logs virtually all its activities in the `debug.log`. This file is critical for diagnosing issues. To locate it, navigate to `.minecraft/logs/debug.log`.

### Crash Reports

Experiencing a crash? Help us identify and fix the issue by sending a crash report. Without this, we're essentially clueless about what went wrong. You can find crash reports at `.minecraft/crash-reports`. Please send the most recent file for analysis.

## Advanced Debugging

The Modern Warfare Cubed documentation is under construction.

Documenting things takes time, like **a lot** of time, so please be patient.
