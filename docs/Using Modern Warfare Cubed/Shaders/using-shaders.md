# Using Shaders
Shaders? I'm not using shaders? Unfortunately, you are. MWC comes with a series of Screen and World shaders that can effect FPS on lower-end computers, and can break compatibility 
with other mods that add their own shaders. (OptiFine, etc)


## Disabling Shaders
You can easily disable all of MWC's shaders by setting enableAllShaders to false in MWC's config file or with the UI in Mod Options.

:::warning

Disabling all shaders can lead to rendering issues on scopes 

:::

## Using custom Shaders
If you just want to be able to play with a custom OptiFine shader, all you need to do is disable all "screenshader" configs in MWC's config file or with the UI in Mod Options.
These shaders have the least effect on gameplay, so you can disable them without any rendering issues.

### Tested Shaders
All shaders tested to work when MWC's screen shaders are disabled.
