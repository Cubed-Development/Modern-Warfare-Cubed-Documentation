# What is Weapon System 2?

:::warning

The Modern Warfare Cubed documentation is under construction.

Documenting things takes time, like **a lot** of time, so please be patient.

:::

Weapon System Two or (WS2) is the animation system used for VMW 3.0. It replaced VS1, but you can still use VS1 methods.


### Upsides
* Animations are set inside a json file
* Animations can be applied with resource packs and reloaded

### Downsides
* Porting from VS1 is difficult
