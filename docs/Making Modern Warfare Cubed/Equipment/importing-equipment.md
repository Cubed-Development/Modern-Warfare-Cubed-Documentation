If you have imported an equipment model, you can now create the actual equipment.

:::note

This assumes that you have [set up the development environment](../setting-up-the-development-environment)

This also assumes that you have [imported the model](../importing-assets)

The Modern Warfare Cubed documentation is under construction.

Documenting things takes time, like **a lot** of time, so please be patient.
